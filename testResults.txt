    -Longest request time: 3.5ms   4ms     4.79ms
    -Average request time: 2.5ms   2.53ms  2.45ms
    
2) 10,000 put/get requests where keys=0:9999 and values=0:9999 repsectively. Success
    -Shortest request time: 2.1ms  2.1ms
    -Longest request time: 3.75ms  100.6ms
    -Average request time: 2.46ms  2.49ms

3) 100 put/get requests to populate DHT. 100 put/get to update previous keys. Success: subsequent gets returned new values

4) 10,000 put/get requests to populate DHT. 10,000 put/get to update previous keys. Success: subsequent gets returned new values

next tests: multiple clients using service simultaneously
            multiple clients simultaneously updating same key

1) 100 put/get requests where keys= and values=0:99 respectively. Success
    -Shortest request time: 2.18ms
    -Longest request time: 4.97ms
    -Average request time: 3.58ms
    
2) 10,000 put/get requests where keys= and values=0:9999 repsectively. 10,000 put/get to update previous keys. 
        Get Request fails on first key (when run script multiple times without resetting DHT).

       On 3,000 (1); 4,000 updates to keys fail.
       On 3,000 (1); 4,000(1) updates succeeded.
       On 5,000 updates succeeded.
       On 3,000 initial get fails at 1,959th key (when run script multiple times without resetting DHT)

Note: the initial tests I ran on Thursday May 1st (10:40AM) were flawed in that in running the script multiple times,
        I violated the assumption that the DHT was empty, an assumption utilized implicitly in the first test case.

Observations ---
    Ran 50+ tests across various system configurations and workloads.
    Coordinators ranged form 1 to 9
    Daemons ranged from 4 to 16
    Workload ranged from 200 to 20,000 gets/puts respectively. (400 to 40,000 total)
    Tests had 2 phases:
    Phase 1 -> store 100 to 10,000 key-value pairs evenly distributed over the keyspace (then assert values later)
    Phase 2 -> update all those ke-value pairs (and assert the new values later)
    
  1) We only observe inconsistency on initial puts ~6-7% with 3 Coordinators and 8 Daemons
     ** Any other configuration provides perfect consistency on gets/puts that are not updates to a key
  2) There does not appear to be a correlation between performance and ratio of coordinators and daemons
  3) Generally much better consistency with small number of daemons
      ** 0% inconsistency with 9/7/5/3/1 Coordinator(s) and 4 Daemons
      **Fewer daemons implies lighter consensus overhead 
  4) Number of coordinators does not appear to affect availability (speed) or consistency
  5) System always available, steady request time of ~3ms across configurations tested
  6) Consistency of updates falls with higher number of Daemons: between 34%  and 99% on updates for certain configurations
